## 🔭 Overview

ObjWatch is a robust Python library designed to streamline the debugging and monitoring of complex projects. By offering real-time tracing of object attributes and method calls, ObjWatch empowers developers to gain deeper insights into their codebases, facilitating issue identification, performance optimization, and overall code quality enhancement.

**⚠️ Performance Notice**

ObjWatch may impact your application's performance. It is recommended to use it solely in debugging environments.

## ✨ Features

- **🌳 Nested Structure Tracing**: Visualize and monitor nested function calls and object interactions with clear, hierarchical logging.
- **📝 Enhanced Logging Support**: Utilize Python's built-in `logging` module for structured, customizable log outputs, including support for simple and detailed formats. Additionally, to ensure logs are captured even if the logger is disabled or removed by external libraries, you can set `level="force"`. When `level` is set to `"force"`, ObjWatch bypasses the standard logging handlers and uses `print()` to output log messages directly to the console, ensuring that critical debugging information is not lost.
- **📋 Logging Message Types**: ObjWatch categorizes log messages into various types to provide detailed insights into code execution. The primary types include:
  
  - **`run`**: Function/method execution start
  - **`end`**: Function/method execution end
  - **`upd`**: Variable creation
  - **`apd`**: Element addition to data structures
  - **`pop`**: Element removal from data structures
  
  These classifications help developers efficiently trace and debug their code by understanding the flow and state changes within their applications.
- **🔥 Multi-GPU Support**: Seamlessly trace distributed PyTorch applications running across multiple GPUs, ensuring comprehensive monitoring in high-performance environments.
- **🔌 Custom Wrapper Extensions**: Extend ObjWatch's functionality with custom wrappers, allowing tailored tracing and logging to fit specific project needs.
- **🎛️ Context Manager & API Integration**: Integrate ObjWatch effortlessly into your projects using context managers or API functions without relying on command-line interfaces.

class SampleClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def increment(self):
        self.value += 1
        time.sleep(0.1)

    def decrement(self):
        self.value -= 1
        time.sleep(0.1)


def main():
    obj = SampleClass(10)
    for _ in range(5):
        obj.increment()
    for _ in range(3):
        obj.decrement()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Using ObjWatch as a context manager
    with objwatch.ObjWatch(['examples/example_usage.py'], output='./objwatch.log', wrapper=BaseWrapper):
        main()

    # Using the watch function
    obj_watch = objwatch.watch(['examples/example_usage.py'], output='./objwatch.log', wrapper=BaseWrapper)
    main()
    obj_watch.stop()

```

## 🪁 Advanced Usage

### Multi-GPU Support

ObjWatch seamlessly integrates with distributed PyTorch applications, allowing you to monitor and trace operations across multiple GPUs. Specify the ranks you wish to track using the `ranks` parameter.

```python
import objwatch

def main():
    # Your distributed code
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    obj_watch = objwatch.watch(['distributed_module.py'], ranks=[0, 1, 2, 3], output='./dist.log, simple=False)
    main()
    obj_watch.stop()
```

### Custom Wrapper Extensions

ObjWatch provides the `ABCWrapper` abstract base class, enabling users to create custom wrappers that extend and customize the library's tracing and logging capabilities. By subclassing `ABCWrapper`, developers can implement tailored behaviors that execute during function calls and returns, offering deeper insights and specialized monitoring suited to their project's specific needs.

#### ABCWrapper Class

The `ABCWrapper` class defines two essential methods that must be implemented:

- **`wrap_call(self, func_name: str, frame: FrameType) -> str`**:
  
  This method is invoked at the beginning of a function call. It receives the function name and the current frame object, which contains the execution context, including local variables and the call stack. Implement this method to extract, log, or modify information before the function executes.

- **`wrap_return(self, func_name: str, result: Any) -> str`**:
  
  This method is called upon a function's return. It receives the function name and the result returned by the function. Use this method to log, analyze, or alter information after the function has completed execution.

- **`wrap_upd(self, old_value: Any, current_value: Any) -> Tuple[str, str]`**:

  This method is triggered when a variable is updated, receiving the old value and the current value. It can be used to log changes to variables, allowing for the tracking and debugging of variable state transitions.

For more details on frame objects, refer to the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.FrameType).

#### Supported Wrappers

The following table outlines the currently supported wrappers, each offering specialized functionality for different tracing and logging needs:

| **Wrapper**                                                         | **Description**                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**BaseWrapper**](objwatch/wrappers/base_wrapper.py)                | Implements basic logging functionality for monitoring function calls and returns.                       |
| [**CPUMemoryWrapper**](objwatch/wrappers/cpu_memory_wrapper.py)     | Uses `psutil.virtual_memory()` to retrieve CPU memory statistics. Allows selection of specific metrics for monitoring CPU memory usage during function execution. |
| [**TensorShapeWrapper**](objwatch/wrappers/tensor_shape_wrapper.py) | Logs the shapes of `torch.Tensor` objects, useful for machine learning and deep learning workflows.     |
| [**TorchMemoryWrapper**](objwatch/wrappers/torch_memory_wrapper.py) | Uses `torch.cuda.memory_stats()` to retrieve GPU memory statistics. Allows selection of specific metrics for monitoring GPU memory usage, including allocation, reservation, and freeing of memory. |

#### TensorShapeWrapper

As an example of a custom wrapper, ObjWatch includes the `TensorShapeWrapper` class within the `objwatch.wrappers` module. This wrapper automatically logs the shapes of tensors involved in function calls, which is particularly beneficial in machine learning and deep learning workflows where tensor dimensions are critical for model performance and debugging.

#### Creating and Integrating Custom Wrappers

To create a custom wrapper:

1. **Subclass `ABCWrapper`**: Define a new class that inherits from `ABCWrapper` and implement the `wrap_call`, `wrap_return` and `wrap_upd` methods to define your custom behavior.

2. **Initialize ObjWatch with the Custom Wrapper**: When initializing `ObjWatch`, pass your custom wrapper via the `wrapper` parameter. This integrates your custom tracing logic into the ObjWatch tracing process.

By leveraging custom wrappers, you can enhance ObjWatch to capture additional context, perform specialized logging, or integrate with other monitoring tools, thereby providing a more comprehensive and tailored tracing solution for your Python projects.

#### Example Use Cases

For example, the `TensorShapeWrapper` can be integrated as follows:

```python
from objwatch.wrappers import TensorShapeWrapper

# Initialize ObjWatch with the custom TensorShapeWrapper
obj_watch = objwatch.ObjWatch(['your_module.py'], simple=False, wrapper=TensorShapeWrapper))
with obj_watch:
    main()
```

#### Example of Using a Custom Wrapper

It is recommended to refer to the  [`tests/test_torch_train.py`](tests/test_torch_train.py)  file. This file contains a complete example of a PyTorch training process, demonstrating how to integrate ObjWatch for monitoring and logging.
